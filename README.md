### My Work In CS284 - Data Structures

My work in this course has been broken down into three assignments, a final project, and a sorting class containing  commonly used sorting algorithms. All of the programming for this course was done in Java.

- Assignment One - Basic implementation of shapes.
- Assignment Two - Doubly Linked List Implementation.
- Assignment Three - Max Heap and Priority Queue Implementation.
- Final Project - TSA Search Simulator!
- Sorting Fun - Insertion, Shell, and Quick sort Implementations.

To get started, make sure you have java installed! Open your terminal or command line and type:
```sh
$ java -version
```
